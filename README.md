# Willard

A parser for [lobbyist registrations](https://solutions.virginia.gov/Lobbyist/Reports/Database) filed with Virginia's Secretary of the Commonwealth. Fetches, transforms, and stores those registrations in machine-readable formats.

Named for the apocryphal story that the term "lobbyist" comes from President Ulysses S. Grant's use of the word to describe influence-peddlers who would seek him out in the lobby of Washington D.C.'s Willard Hotel.
